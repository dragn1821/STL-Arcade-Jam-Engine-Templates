# STL Arcade Jam Engine Templates

Example template for games made for the St. Louis Arcade Jam 2018. If you have suggestions feel free to submit issues with those requests or make the changes yourself and submit a pull request. This project is intentionally kept simple so that people do not feel constrained beyond approximately 3-minute long play sessions and a limited pre-defined set of buttons.
